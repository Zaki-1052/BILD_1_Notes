# BILD 1 Lecture 2
- ## 1/10
	- ### Size/Scale
	- ### Bonds

## Review

### Life Definitions

- Ecosystem definition of life:
	- Entity is part of an ecosystem
- Functional definition of life:
	- Entity does functions associated with life
- Cell theory:
	- Entity is a cell
- Evolutionary definition of life:
	- Entity has genetic material that can mutate, introducing mutations that make offspring more or less successful at reproducing

## Overview

-  Use various definitions of life, such as cell theory and the evolutionary definition, to determine whether real or hypothetical things are alive.
- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**
- Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.
### Questions

- How do biologists think about size and scale? 
- What are cells made of? 
- What are biological molecules made of?

### Agenda

- Size and Scale in biology
- Types of cell and cell structure
- Biological macromolecules and the bonds in them

### Objective

- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**

## Size and Scale

### On Human Terms

- Largest to smallest:
	- mitochondrion, virus, hemoglobin, glucose, water molecule

### Questions

- Is the object a cell?
	- (e.g. bacterial cell, yeast cell, human body cell, plant cell, amoeba)
- Is it a membrane-bound organelle inside a cell?
	- (e.g. mitochondrion, chloroplast)
- Is it a collection of molecules?
	- (e.g. virus, ribosome)
- Is it a single big molecule?
	- (e.g. hemoglobin, DNA)
- Is it a single small molecule?
	- (e.g. water, carbon dioxide)

## Cell Types

### Objective

- **Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.**

### Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic

#### Prokaryotes

- • Bacteria, archaea
- No membrane-bound nucleus
- No membrane-bound organelles
- Usually smaller, single-celled
	- simple bag

#### Prokaryotic Cell

-  **DNA**, but not in a nucleus
• **Ribosomes** (which make proteins) and other things, but nothing with a membrane around it

#### Eukaryotes

- Animals, plants, fungi (inc. yeast), amoebas
- Has membrane-bound nucleus
- Has membrane-bound organelles
- Usually bigger, often multicellular
	- bag of bags

#### Eukaryotic Cell

-  DNA in a **nucleus**
- Membrane-bound organelles:
	- **Chloroplasts**: 
		- Do photosynthesis
	- **Mitochondria**: 
		- Uses oxygen to makes energy from sugar
	- **Endoplasmic reticulum** and **Golgi apparatus**: 
		- Along with ribosomes, make and process some types of proteins
	- **Lysosome**: 
		- Break stuff down

#### Lysosomes

- The lysosome’s functions include using enzymes (proteins that do chemical reactions) to break down certain biological molecules. Why would it be functional for eukaryotic cells to have these enzymes inside a membrane-bound organelle?
	- To ensure the enzymes won’t break down necessary molecules in the cell.
	- To create a more efficient environment for those enzymes to encounter their targets.
- ##### **Structure aids function.**

### Viruses
(not a cell)
- Small!
- RNA or DNA inside
- Protein coat 
	- (not a true cell membrane with proteins AND lipids)
- Polymyxin B is an antibiotic that works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. Do you think it would be effective against a viral infection?
	- No. 
	- Remember that viruses are not cells! 
	- Many antibiotics target structures in bacteria that viruses lack.

### Mitochondria

- The mitochondrion and the bacterium are roughly the same size…
- Mitochondria contain their own DNA…

#### Big Idea

- **Big Idea: Some organelles were likely once free-living bacteria!**
	- Like the mitochondrion!
	- (And the chloroplast!)
		- They have their own DNA and resemble bacteria internally.
		- This idea is called endosymbiotic theory.
