# BILD 1 Lecture 2
- ## 1/10
	- ## Size/Scale
	- ## Bonds

## Review

- Cell Theory of life:
	- lipid membrane = cell
	- virus = protein shell
		- no membrane
			- not alive

### Life Definitions

- Ecosystem definition of life:
	- Entity is part of an ecosystem
- Functional definition of life:
	- Entity does functions associated with life
- Cell theory:
	- Entity is a cell
- Evolutionary definition of life:
	- Entity has genetic material that can mutate, introducing mutations that make offspring more or less successful at reproducing

## Overview

-  Use various definitions of life, such as cell theory and the evolutionary definition, to determine whether real or hypothetical things are alive.
- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**
- Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.
### Questions

- How do biologists think about size and scale? 
- What are cells made of? 
- What are biological molecules made of?

### Agenda

- Size and Scale in biology
- Types of cell and cell structure
- Biological macromolecules and the bonds in them

### Objective

- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**

## Size and Scale

### On Human Terms

- Largest to smallest:
	- mitochondrion, virus, hemoglobin, glucose, water molecule

### Questions

- Is the object a cell?
	- (e.g. bacterial cell, yeast cell, human body cell, plant cell, amoeba)
- Is it a membrane-bound organelle inside a cell?
	- (e.g. mitochondrion, chloroplast)
- Is it a collection of molecules?
	- (e.g. virus, ribosome)
- Is it a single big molecule?
	- (e.g. hemoglobin, DNA)
- Is it a single small molecule?
	- (e.g. water, carbon dioxide)

## Cell Types

### Objective

- **Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.**

### Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic

#### Prokaryotes

- Bacteria, archaea
- No membrane-bound nucleus
- No membrane-bound organelles
- Usually smaller, single-celled
	- simple bag

#### Prokaryotic Cell

- **DNA**, but not in a nucleus
- **Ribosomes** (which make proteins) and other things, but nothing with a membrane around it

#### Eukaryotes

- Animals, plants, fungi (inc. yeast), amoebas
- Has membrane-bound nucleus
- Has membrane-bound organelles
- Usually bigger, often multicellular
	- bag of bags

#### Eukaryotic Cell

-  DNA in a **nucleus**
- Membrane-bound organelles:
	- **Chloroplasts**: 
		- Do photosynthesis
	- **Mitochondria**: 
		- Uses oxygen to makes energy from sugar
	- **Endoplasmic reticulum** and **Golgi apparatus**: 
		- Along with ribosomes, make and process some types of proteins
	- **Lysosome**: 
		- Break stuff down

#### Lysosomes

- The lysosome’s functions include using enzymes (proteins that do chemical reactions) to break down certain biological molecules. Why would it be functional for eukaryotic cells to have these enzymes inside a membrane-bound organelle?
	- To ensure the enzymes won’t break down necessary molecules in the cell.
	- To create a more efficient environment for those enzymes to encounter their targets.
- ##### **Structure aids function.**

### Viruses
(not a cell)
- Small!
- RNA or DNA inside
- Protein coat 
	- (not a true cell membrane with proteins AND lipids)
- Polymyxin B is an antibiotic that works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. Do you think it would be effective against a viral infection?
	- No. 
	- Remember that viruses are not cells! 
	- Many antibiotics target structures in bacteria that viruses lack.

### Mitochondria

- The mitochondrion and the bacterium are roughly the same size…
- Mitochondria contain their own DNA…

#### Big Idea

- **Big Idea: Some organelles were likely once free-living bacteria!**
	- Like the **mitochondrion**!
	- (And the **chloroplast**!)
		- They have their own DNA and resemble bacteria internally.
		- This idea is called **endosymbiotic theory**.

structure and function of the **molecules** that make up cells:

## Biological Macromolecules

### Learning Objectives

- **Distinguish between a covalent bond, ionic bond, and hydrogen bond in terms of the energy needed to break it and what types of atoms can engage in the bond.**
- Use a molecule’s chemical structure to predict whether it will be hydrophobic or hydrophilic.

### Cell Structure

#### Big Idea

- Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes are made from the same types of macromolecules:
	- Carbohydrates
	- Proteins
	- Nucleic Acids
	- Lipids

#### Classes of Biological Macromolecules

##### Carbohydrates
- Plant structure
- Energy
- Starch
- Energy
- Sugar
##### Proteins
- Perform functions
- Make reactions
- Prions
- Muscle
##### Nucleic Acids
- DNA
- RNA
- Stores Information
##### Lipids
- Fats
- Membranes
- Energy Storage
- Cholesterol

### Big Idea

- Molecules are made of **atoms**. 
	- Atoms are connected by **bonds**.
		- *Note: whenever there’s a bend and we don’t write an atom’s symbol, you can assume there is a Carbon there and possibly some number of hydrogens connected to it.*
- Question:
	- This molecule is a form of thyroid hormone, which is crucial for normal growth and brain development. To make it, you need to eat iodine atoms. Why can’t the body just make iodine?
		- Only nuclear reactions, like those in stars or as part of radioactivity, can make or destroy atoms.
		- However, once you have atoms inside your body, you can mix and remix them to make different molecules (if you have the right proteins that can help).

### Bonds

#### Water

- Water is necessary for life.
- The body’s chemical reactions take place in water.
- Water forms polar **covalent bonds** and **hydrogen bonds**.
	- Hydrogen bonds are:
		- Weak bonds

#### Chemical Bonds

##### Ionic Bonds
- Ionic Bonds: Takes all electrons
- End result:
	- One atom gets a + charge
	- Another atom gets a - charge
##### Covalent Bonds
- Covalent Bonds: Shares electrons between them
	- But electrons are not always shared equally
- Some atoms attract electrons more than others
	- Increasing ability to attract electrons
		- --> Across a period -->
	- In chemistry, the ability to attract electrons is called **electronegativity**.
- **Nonpolar bonds**: 
	- are covalent bonds where the atoms share electrons equally: 
		- C-C, C-H
- **Polar bonds**:
	- are covalent bonds where the atoms share electrons unequally: 
		- O-H, N-H, C-O, C-N
##### Hydrogen Bonds
- **Hydrogen Bonds**: 
	- When the electrons next to atom are attractive.
	- Partial + charge on one atom is attracted to partial - charge on another atom.
		- …between water molecules
		- …between DNA molecules

#### Key Ideas

##### Bonds in Water

-  The oxygen is connected to the hydrogen by single **polar covalent bonds**.
- **Oxygen is attracted to hydrogens** on other molecules through **hydrogen bonds**.

### Macromolecules Objectives

- **Use a molecule’s chemical structure to predict whether it will be hydrophobic or hydrophilic.**

#### Process
- Most molecules in a cell move freely in water...but sometimes cells must keep them separate.
	- Enzyme breaks down proteins
	- Barrier between two compartments that does NOT mix with water
- Oil and Water Don't Mix

#### Hydrophobic vs. Hydrophilic

- Oil and other things that have mostly **nonpolar bonds** (**hydrophobic**).
	- **Bonds without charges** are not attracted to water but are to each other.
- Water, and things with lots of **polar covalent or ionic bonds** (**hydrophilic**).
	- The partial + and - charges on water are attracted to other **partial or full charges**.

##### Example

- Oleic Acid
	- 18 Carbons
		- Every time there is a point/bend
- Bonds and Polarity:
	- **Hydrophobic**
		- most of the bonds are nonpolar C-C and C-H bonds.
			- olive oil
- Cows can develop a brain disease calledbovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as mad cow disease. If people eat the meat of a diseased cow, they can get the disease too. What do you think the agent that causes BSE has?
	- A. Protein

| Bonds                 | Polarity |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| Many C-C Bonds        | Nonpolar |
| Many, many, C-H Bonds | Nonpolar |
| 2 C-O bonds           | Polar    |
| 1 O-H                 | Polar    |
