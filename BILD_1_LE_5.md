# BILD 1 Lecture 5
- ## 1/24
	- ## Membrane Transport

## Cell Membranes

### Amphipathic Phospholipids

- **Phospholipids are amphipathic**
	- **Hydrophillic** and **Hydrophobic**
		- Head: 
			- **Hydrophilic**
				- (+ and – charges)
		- Tail:
			- **Hydrophobic**
				- (mostly nonpolar C-C and C-H bonds)

### Phospholipid Bilayer

- **Cell membranes are made of a phospholipid bilayer**
- Creates an inside and an outside that are separate, where different things can go on.
	- But sometimes a cell needs to transport things into or out of the cell
### Transportation

- Transporting things in and out of cells
1. **Diffusion**: 
	- Some things can pass through a lipid bilayer on their own.
2. **Facilitated passive transport**: 
	- Some things cannot pass on their own, but if you open a passage to **let them through the membrane using a protein**, they will go through in the direction the cell wants.
3. **Active transport**:
	- Some things cannot pass on their own, and they would go in the wrong direction, so you need to **use energy to get a protein to transport them** in the right direction.
4. **Bulk transport**: Some things are too big for a single protein to transport.
#### Example
- How to determine whether something will go through a membrane on its own:
	- Will a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic substance go through the membrane more easily?
		- A. Hydrophobic. 
			- Hydrophobic substances won’t be repelled by the tails, so they can enter and pass through the membrane lipid bilayer easily.
	- Hydrophobic things go through a lot more easily than hydrophilic things. 
		- Charged is worst.
	- Small things go through more easily than big things.
##### Image 
- The hydrophobic tails make up most of this distance.

##### Question
- Which of these molecules will pass through a lipid bilayer membrane most easily?
	- Sort the permeabilities of these substances through a lipid bilayer
	- Relative permeabilities:
		1. Cholesterol: best 
			- (hydrophobic)
		2. Water: mediocre 
			- (small & polar)
		3. Glucose: bad 
			- (hydrophilic & on the larger side)
		4. Sodium: bad 
			- (charged)
#### Semipermeability
- ##### **Cell membranes are semipermeable**
- The cell membrane is “**semipermeable**”:
- Some things can just go through, but not everything.
	- lipid-soluble (hydrophobic)
	- molecules and small,
	- uncharged molecules (O2, CO2)

### Protein Transport
- Some things cannot pass on their own, but if you let them through the membrane using a protein, they will go through in the direction the cell wants. – *Facilitated passive transport*
- ##### **Proteins help get non-hydrophobic compounds through the membrane**
- There are many proteins in cell membranes.
	- Some of them help transport substances through membranes.
#### Question
- Which of these amino acids is most likely to be present in the part of a membrane protein that is touching the membrane’s hydrophobic tails?
	- A. Phenylalanine
		- The side chain of phenylalanine only has nonpolar bonds (C-C and C-H). It would be attracted to the similarly nonpolar, hydrophobic tails.
#### Protein Types
- ##### 2 types of proteins allow molecules to pass through membranes
	- **Channel proteins** have a hole that can be used as a tunnel through the membrane.
		- Example: channel proteins called **aquaporins** allow water to pass
	- **Carrier proteins (or transporters)** bind to substances and change shape to shuttle them across the membrane.
#### Selectivity and Gating
- Each channel, carrier, and pump will only allow certain molecules to pass: 
	- **selectivity**
		- Example: 
			- Cl- channels will have sections of the protein with lots of positively charged amino acid side chains, to attract Cl- ions.
- Some channels are only open during certain conditions, like if another molecule is present: 
	- **gating**
- ##### Why this matters:
	- **thinking involves ion movements in brain cells**
		- Brain cells produce electrical signals when they allow charged ions to enter or exit the cell.
		- The channels for the ions are gated and only open at certain times, which means that these electrical signals are only produced at certain times.

### Water Movement
- **Movement of Water**:
- Things to know:
	- **Most cells have aquaporin channels on them**, letting water move freely in and out
	- Most cells only let salts move sometimes
	- **Gatorade is less salty than blood** and other internal body fluids
#### Diffusion and Osmosis
- ##### **Predicting movement across the membrane**:
	- When they can, **molecules tend to go to locations where their concentration is lower**.
		- This is called going **down their concentration gradient**.
	- **Osmosis** is the diffusion of water.
##### Image

#### Questions
1. Let’s say that Cynthia Lucero drank so much Gatorade that it diluted her blood.
	- How will water move?
	- Before the marathon, her cells were about equals level of saltiness inside and out.
		- A. Salt will move out of the cell to the blood: 
			- No, low permeability to salt
		- **B. Water will move into the cell from the blood**
		- C. Water will move into the cell, but so will salt: 
			- No, it’s more salty on the inside
		- D. Water will move out of the cell to the blood: 
			- No, it’s more watery on the outside
2. The membrane in the middle is permeable only to water. 
	- What would you expect in this scenario?
		- A. Solute to move from left to right
		- B. Solute to move from right to left
			- A, B: No, because this membrane doesn’t let sugar through
		- C. Water to move from left to right
		- **D. Water to move from right to left**
			- *Yes*! **It is less watery on the left, so the water will move left**
3. What would happen if an animal cell were put in a solution with a higher than average concentration of solutes?
	- D. It will shrivel.
		- If the solution outside is salty, that means it is less watery than the inside of the cell. 
			- So the water will leave, and the inside will shrivel.
- What happened to Cynthia Lucero?
	- Cynthia was afraid of dehydration, so she accidentally **drank too much Gatorade**, diluting her blood.
		- This is called **hyponatremia**, or having too little salt in the blood.
	- **Her blood was watery, so the water entered her cells**, including her brain cells.
		- Her brain swelled, causing a coma and death.
##### Summary:
- Movement of water relative to the outside solution
	- Solution outside is extremely salty
	- Solution outside is pure water
		- (or Gatorade)
	- Solution outside cell has same concentration as that inside
#### Diffusion is not the whole story
- If only diffusion and osmosis occurred, the concentration of things inside and outside the cell would be nearly equal.
	- That is not the case.
- After you eat, cells in your intestine need to pick up glucose sugar from your food.
	- Even though the cells have a lot already, they need to pick up more.
		- **Need to transport glucose <u><b><i>against</i></b></u> its concentration gradient.**

### Active Transport
- Some things cannot pass on their own, and they would go in the wrong direction, so you need to use energy to get a protein to transport them in the right direction. – Active transport
- ##### **Some proteins that allow molecules to pass through membranes**
- **Pump proteins** ==use energy (in the form of ATP)== to bind to substances and change shape to shuttle them across the membrane.
##### Image

#### Membrane Movement and Energy
- If a molecule is moving **down its concentration gradient** (*from higher to lower concentration*), it **doesn’t** need energy.
	- Can use a **channel or carrier**
- If a molecule is moving **against its concentration gradient** (*from lower to higher concentration*), it **does** need energy.
	- Must use a **pump**
##### Sodium-potassium pump
- **Most common pump:**
	- Sodium-potassium pump
		- It pumps: 
			- 3 Na+ out of the cell, 2 K+ into the cell
		- It uses energy 
			- (in the form of ATP)
###### Image
![[sodiumPump.png]]
#### Gradients
- ##### **Sodium-potassium pump and gradients**
- Question:
	- With the sodium- potassium pump running, if you open a potassium channel, which way will the potassium tend to go through the channel?
		- Because it pumps: 
			- 3 Na+ out of the cell, 
			- 2 K+ into the cell --> 
				- it **creates** concentration gradients.
###### Image
![[concentrationGradients.png]]

##### Question 
- With the sodium-potassium pump running, if you open a potassium **channel**, which way will the potassium tend to go through the **channel**?
	- B. **Out of the cell.** 
		- The pump causes there to be a higher concentration of K+ inside the cell. 
			- So, when the channel opens, the K+ leaves the cell.
- Intestinal cells have a transporter that transports Na+ down its gradient. 
- Every time it does that, it also transports a glucose in the same direction as the Na+.
	- How will the glucose be transported?
	- Remember the sodium gradient that happens because of the sodium-potassium pump:
		- **B. From the outside to the inside of the cell**
			- The Na/K pump creates a higher concentration of sodium outside the cell. 
				- So, when the transporter transports Na+, the Na enters the cell. 
					- Therefore, so does the glucose.
#### Big Picture: 
- ##### **Transporting things against their gradient**
	- The transporter uses concentration gradients created by the Na/K pump to do another task!
		- Many substances are transported against their concentration gradients in this way.

### Bulk Transport
- Some things are too big for a single protein to transport. – **Bulk transport**
- **How cells move something that can’t fit through a channel, pump, or transporter**:
	- Endocytosis: 
		- a pocket of membrane folds in to engulf and take in large substances
	- Exocytosis: 
		- a pocket merges with the cell membrane and spits out large substances
	- **Example**: 
		- Immune cells called macrophages
			- Do a type of **endocytosis** called **phagocytosis** to swallow and kill bacteria.

### Summary: Membrane Transport
- **Passive transport**: 
	- No energy needed; substances go from high to low concentration
		- Simple diffusion: 
			- Substances diffuse through membrane on their own
		- Facilitated diffusion: 
			- Substances use a **channel** or **transporter** to move through the membrane
		- **Osmosis** is *diffusion of water*
- **Active transport**: 
	- Need ATP energy; 
	- substances go from low to high concentration
		- **Pumps** for small things
		- **Endocytosis** / **exocytosis** for big things
