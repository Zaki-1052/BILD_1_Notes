# BILD 1 Lecture 1
- ## 1/8
	- ### Meaning of Life
	- ### Size and Scale in biology

### Questions

- What makes something alive? 
- How do biologists think about size and scale?
	- https://www.wehi.edu.au/wehi-tv

## Principles of Life: Objectives

- **Use various definitions of life, such as cell theory and the evolutionary definition, to determine whether real or hypothetical things are alive.**
- Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.
- Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.

### What is Life

- A. … play a role in living ecosystems.
- B. … reproduce, grow, and use energy.
- C. … are made of cells.
- D. … evolve.

- Fire - plays a role in ecosystem
	- uses energy
	- respires
	- reproduces
	- makes waste
	- moves
	- responds to stimuli
	- grows
- Cells carry out **functions**
	- Cell dysfunction causes disease

### Cell Theory

- **Cell theory**: Living things are those things made up of **one or more cells**.
- Structure-based definition (based on what things are *made of*)
- **Why this definition is useful**: It’s very clear what is or isn’t a cell. 
	- **Under this definition**, a cell is the simplest collection of matter that is alive.
	- Structure-based

#### Definition

> [!Definition]
> - All cells have an <u>outer layer (membrane)</u>, *made of lipids and proteins*, that **regulates** what **enters and leaves the cell**.

### Structure of Viruses

- Teal, orange, purple, blue: 
	- **Protein** only
		- Functions as a shell
- Red: 
	- **RNA** genetic material
		- Some viruses have **DNA** as their genetic material

#### How viruses function

1. Viruses enter a cell
2. They use that cell’s machinery to **replicate themselves**, but sometimes there are **mutations**
3. **Viruses with certain mutations replicate better and become more abundant.**

- Viruses = **not** a living thing based on **cell theory**
	- Viruses do **not** have a cell membrane-
		- their outer shell is only made of proteins and does not let substances in and out. 
		- They are **not** cells.
			- proteins not lipids -- no membrane
			- membrane essential to cells

#### Issues with cell theory

- Viruses share a lot of life-like characteristics with organisms who have cells?
- Could there be other forms of life, for example those on other planets, that lack cells but we might want to consider alive?

### Evolutionary Definitions of Life

- **Evolutionary definition**: 
	- Living things are **systems that undergo evolution through natural selection**.
- They have a **genetic code** that can **change (mutate)**
- The genetic code is **passed to the next generation**
- Based on the changes they inherit, **offspring can reproduce more or less**
- **Why this definition is useful**: 
	- It is also clear and encompasses many things that are life-like but don’t have cells.

- Viruses = **is** a **living thing** under **evolutionary theory**
- Viruses have **genetic material** that can **mutate**, they **pass it on** to their offspring, and the **offspring can replicate more if they have certain mutations**.
- **Fire** == **NOT** alive under either theory
	- Fires lack cells. 
		- They reproduce, but they don’t pass on genetic information to their offspring.

## Size and Scale

- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**

### Structure and Function

- Living things are made up of molecules that obey **physical and chemical laws**.
- Thinking about the relationship between structure and function will help you **learn, see, and understand**, not just memorize.
- **Order:** Largest to smallest
	- mitochondrion, virus, hemoglobin, glucose, water molecule
- Size and scale:
	- What you already know about size and scale
	- What things are made of, their structure
	- What strategies are you using?
