# BILD 1 Lecture 3
- ## 1/13
	- ## DNA
	  ## Proteins

## Overview
### Questions
- What are biological molecules made of? 
- How do the structures of DNA and proteins enable their functions?
### Agenda
- Water
- The structure of DNA
- The structure of proteins
### Objective
- Distinguish between a covalent bond, ionic bond, and hydrogen bond in terms of the energy needed to break it and what types of atoms can engage in the bond.

## Water Molecules
### Hydrophobic vs. Hydrophillic
#### Hydrophic
- Oil and other things that have mostly **nonpolar bonds** (**hydrophobic**).
	- **Bonds without charges** are not attracted to water but are to each other.
#### Hydrophilic
- Water, and things with lots of **polar covalent or ionic bonds (hydrophilic)**.
	- The partial + and - charges on water are attracted to other **partial or full charges**.

### Big Ideas
- Covalent bonds are very strong.
- O and N “attract” electrons more strongly than C and H, so O-H, O-C, N-C, N-H bonds are “polar” (partially charged).
	- C-H and C-C bonds are non-polar
- Things that are polar attract other things that are polar or charged and repel non-polar things.
- \+ and – charges attract.

### Bonds in Water

- **Polar covalent bonds**
	- Covalent bonds are **solid lines** because they are **strong**:
		- they are **within** a molecule
- O-H is **polar** because O attracts electrons better than H does
- **Hydrogen bonds**
	- **Dotted line** because they are an attraction **between** molecules
	- Partial + attracts partial – from polar bonds

## Biological Macromolecules
- **Describe structural features and functions of DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids and explain how their structures relate to their functions.**
### Polymers
- A **polymer** is a molecule consisting of an **indefinitely long** chain of similar building blocks called **monomers**.
	- Nucleic Acids 
		- (ie DNA and RNA)
	- Proteins
	- Lipids
### DNA
- (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
- Monomer:
	- Nucleotide
- Polymer: 
	- (2 strands)
- Sugar is deoxyribose
	- Base can be adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C)
#### Structure Idea #1:
- Two DNA molecules together form a double helix.
- The different parts of **nucleotides** make up different parts of the double helix!
	- Phosphate & Sugar = Rail
	- Nitrogenous Base = Half of a Stair Step
#### DNA: Structure and Function
##### Structure:
- **There are 4 bases, which can be in any order on a strand**

- 2 strands held together by hydrogen bonds
- Each base matches with exactly 1 other base on the other strand
##### Function:
- 26 letters in English, can, if you put them in different orders, encode many kinds of information
- 2 numbers (0&1) in computer code can, if you put them in different orders, encode many kinds of information
- **4 bases in 1 strand of DNA can also encode information in organisms**

- “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible **copying mechanism for the genetic material**.”
#### Structure Idea #2: 
- Hydrogen Bonds Hold the Stair Steps (the Bases) Together
	- Break the two strands of DNA apart
##### Complementary base pairs
- In DNA, there are 4 bases: 
	- A, T, G, and C
- The structures of these bases are aligned so that:
	- A pairs with T
	- G pairs with C
### RNA
#### RNA vs. DNA
- RNA Monomer: **Nucleotide**
	- Sugar is **ribose** (with an **OH**)
	- Bases can be adenine (**A**), **uracil (U)**, guanine (**G**), or cytosine (**C**)
	- U pairs with A
- DNA Monomer: **Nucleotide**
	- Sugar is **deoxyribose**
	- Base can be adenine (**A**), thymine (**T**), guanine (**G**), or cytosine (**C**)
#### RNA Structure and Function
- That OH instead of an H means that…
	- RNA can take a variety of shapes:
		- It can base-pair with itself and with DNA, but it can take other shapes too.
			- RNAs sometimes fold in on themselves to partially base-pair
- **OH is more chemically reactive**, so that OH instead of an H means that…
	- **Different RNAs can have different functions:**
		- Carry genetic information
		- Bind to and regulate the function of DNA
		- Bind to other molecules and carry them around
		- Doing chemical reactions inside the cell
	- **RNA is less stable** 
		- (falls apart more readily)
##### Proteins
###### Question
- Cows can develop a brain disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as mad cow disease. If people eat the meat of a diseased cow, they can get the disease too. **What do you think the agent that causes BSE has?**
	- Protein
- The infectious agent in mad cow is pure **protein**

- Protein is called a **prion**
- Polymer of **amino acids**, where different amino acids are represented by different letters
##### Roles of proteins in the cells
- Facilitating chemical reactions
- Moving things around the cell
- Giving a cell its shape
- Create body movement, cause pathogens to die, form nails and hair, etc. …
###### Importance
- **Proteins are one way to treat disease**
- Most “biologic” drugs are proteins
	- Diabetes 
		- (insulin)
	- Arthritis 
		- (Humira, Enbrel)
	- Cancer drugs 
		- (Herceptin, Avastin, Neulasta)
	- Asthma 
		- (dupilumab)
### Proteins
- Monomer:
	- **Amino acid**
		- Side chain: 
			- One of 20
- Polymer:
	- **Backbone**:
		- Always the same 
			- (+NH3-CH-COO-)
#### Amino Acid Parts
##### Side Chain
- **Structure**: 
	- *variable*
		- ***Always*** attached to **alpha carbon**
- **Function**: 
	- its chemistry give proteins their shape and function
- To identify the side chain, find the alpha carbon
##### Backbone
- **Structure**: 
	- *always the same*
		- (+NH3-CH-COO-)
- **Function**:
	- how the amino acid links to other amino acids to form a peptide
##### Amine
- NH2 or NH3+
- Binds to the carboxyl of another amino acid
##### Carboxyl
- COO- or COOH
- Binds to the amine of another amino acid
##### Alpha carbon
- Will always be bound to:
	1. the carboxyl 
		- (COO- or COOH)
	2. the amine 
		- (NH3 or NH2)
	3. a hydrogen atom 
		- (H)
	4. **The Side Chain**
#### Side Chain Types
![[sideChains.png]]
- Note on chemical structures: A full + or – charge will always be indicated. 
- A partial charge usually won’t be.
##### Amino acids joining together
- COO- from one amino acids joins with NH3+ from other amino acid. 
- R is side chain.
###### Questions
- Do the side chains participate in joining the amino acids together?
	- No. Side chains remain and are responsible for protein structure and function!
- Do the charges on the backbone still exist after the amino acids join together?
	- No. There are no charges on the new bond (circled).
- Note: Nonpolar side chain b/c:
	- Only the side chain matters.
		- Remember, the charges on the backbone go away when the amino acid becomes part of a protein.
- If there is a section of a protein that needs to attract negatively-charged ions like Cl-, which of these amino acids might best perform that function?
	- To attract – ions, you need + charges.
	- Arginine was the only one of the choices that had a + charge in the side chain.
	- *Problems in proteins that transport Cl- ions can lead to seizures, cystic fibrosis, and other health problems.*
- How can mad cow disease spread from a cow to a person if prions have no genetic material?
###### Extra
- linear order of amino acids in polypeptide chain
- held together by peptide bonds between amino acids
- tight coils or flat sheets
