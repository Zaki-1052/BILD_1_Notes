- How do biologists think about size and scale?
	- https://www.wehi.edu.au/wehi-tv

## Principles of Life: Objectives

- **Use various definitions of life, such as cell theory and the evolutionary definition, to determine whether real or hypothetical things are alive.**
- Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.
- Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.

### What is Life

- A. … play a role in living ecosystems.
- B. … reproduce, grow, and use energy.
- C. … are made of cells.
- D. … evolve.

- Fire - plays a role in ecosystem
	- uses energy
	- respires
	- reproduces
	- makes waste
	- moves
	- responds to stimuli
	- grows
- Cells carry out **functions**
	- Cell dysfunction causes disease

### Cell Theory

- **Cell theory**: Living things are those things made up of **one or more cells**.
- Structure-based definition (based on what things are *made of*)
- **Why this definition is useful**: It’s very clear what is or isn’t a cell. 
	- **Under this definition**, a cell is the simplest collection of matter that is alive.
	- Structure-based

#### Definition

> [!Definition]
> - All cells have an <u>outer layer (membrane)</u>, *made of lipids and proteins*, that **regulates** what **enters and leaves the cell**.

### Structure of Viruses

- Teal, orange, purple, blue: 
	- **Protein** only
		- Functions as a shell
- Red: 
	- **RNA** genetic material
		- Some viruses have **DNA** as their genetic material

#### How viruses function

1. Viruses enter a cell
2. They use that cell’s machinery to **replicate themselves**, but sometimes there are **mutations**
3. **Viruses with certain mutations replicate better and become more abundant.**

- Viruses = **not** a living thing based on **cell theory**
	- Viruses do **not** have a cell membrane-
		- their outer shell is only made of proteins and does not let substances in and out. 
		- They are **not** cells.
			- proteins not lipids -- no membrane
			- membrane essential to cells

#### Issues with cell theory

- Viruses share a lot of life-like characteristics with organisms who have cells?
- Could there be other forms of life, for example those on other planets, that lack cells but we might want to consider alive?

### Evolutionary Definitions of Life

- **Evolutionary definition**: 
	- Living things are **systems that undergo evolution through natural selection**.
- They have a **genetic code** that can **change (mutate)**
- The genetic code is **passed to the next generation**
- Based on the changes they inherit, **offspring can reproduce more or less**
- **Why this definition is useful**: 
	- It is also clear and encompasses many things that are life-like but don’t have cells.

- Viruses = **is** a **living thing** under **evolutionary theory**
- Viruses have **genetic material** that can **mutate**, they **pass it on** to their offspring, and the **offspring can replicate more if they have certain mutations**.
- **Fire** == **NOT** alive under either theory
	- Fires lack cells. 
		- They reproduce, but they don’t pass on genetic information to their offspring.

## Size and Scale

- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**

### Structure and Function

- Living things are made up of molecules that obey **physical and chemical laws**.
- Thinking about the relationship between structure and function will help you **learn, see, and understand**, not just memorize.
- **Order:** Largest to smallest
	- mitochondrion, virus, hemoglobin, glucose, water molecule
- Size and scale:
	- What you already know about size and scale
	- What things are made of, their structure
	- What strategies are you using?

	- ## Size/Scale
	- ## Bonds

## Review

- Cell Theory of life:
	- lipid membrane = cell
	- virus = protein shell
		- no membrane
			- not alive

### Life Definitions

- Ecosystem definition of life:
	- Entity is part of an ecosystem
- Functional definition of life:
	- Entity does functions associated with life
- Cell theory:
	- Entity is a cell
- Evolutionary definition of life:
	- Entity has genetic material that can mutate, introducing mutations that make offspring more or less successful at reproducing

## Overview

-  Use various definitions of life, such as cell theory and the evolutionary definition, to determine whether real or hypothetical things are alive.
- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**
- Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.
### Questions

- How do biologists think about size and scale? 
- What are cells made of? 
- What are biological molecules made of?

### Agenda

- Size and Scale in biology
- Types of cell and cell structure
- Biological macromolecules and the bonds in them

### Objective

- **Order from smallest to largest in size biological entities such as viruses, prokaryotic cells, proteins, ribosomes, yeast cells, and water molecules.**

## Size and Scale

### On Human Terms

- Largest to smallest:
	- mitochondrion, virus, hemoglobin, glucose, water molecule

### Questions

- Is the object a cell?
	- (e.g. bacterial cell, yeast cell, human body cell, plant cell, amoeba)
- Is it a membrane-bound organelle inside a cell?
	- (e.g. mitochondrion, chloroplast)
- Is it a collection of molecules?
	- (e.g. virus, ribosome)
- Is it a single big molecule?
	- (e.g. hemoglobin, DNA)
- Is it a single small molecule?
	- (e.g. water, carbon dioxide)

## Cell Types

### Objective

- **Compare and contrast the structure of prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, viruses, and prions.**

### Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic

#### Prokaryotes

- Bacteria, archaea
- No membrane-bound nucleus
- No membrane-bound organelles
- Usually smaller, single-celled
	- simple bag

#### Prokaryotic Cell

- **DNA**, but not in a nucleus
- **Ribosomes** (which make proteins) and other things, but nothing with a membrane around it

#### Eukaryotes

- Animals, plants, fungi (inc. yeast), amoebas
- Has membrane-bound nucleus
- Has membrane-bound organelles
- Usually bigger, often multicellular
	- bag of bags

#### Eukaryotic Cell

-  DNA in a **nucleus**
- Membrane-bound organelles:
	- **Chloroplasts**: 
		- Do photosynthesis
	- **Mitochondria**: 
		- Uses oxygen to makes energy from sugar
	- **Endoplasmic reticulum** and **Golgi apparatus**: 
		- Along with ribosomes, make and process some types of proteins
	- **Lysosome**: 
		- Break stuff down

#### Lysosomes

- The lysosome’s functions include using enzymes (proteins that do chemical reactions) to break down certain biological molecules. Why would it be functional for eukaryotic cells to have these enzymes inside a membrane-bound organelle?
	- To ensure the enzymes won’t break down necessary molecules in the cell.
	- To create a more efficient environment for those enzymes to encounter their targets.
- ##### **Structure aids function.**

### Viruses
(not a cell)
- Small!
- RNA or DNA inside
- Protein coat 
	- (not a true cell membrane with proteins AND lipids)
- Polymyxin B is an antibiotic that works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. Do you think it would be effective against a viral infection?
	- No. 
	- Remember that viruses are not cells! 
	- Many antibiotics target structures in bacteria that viruses lack.

### Mitochondria

- The mitochondrion and the bacterium are roughly the same size…
- Mitochondria contain their own DNA…

#### Big Idea

- **Big Idea: Some organelles were likely once free-living bacteria!**
	- Like the **mitochondrion**!
	- (And the **chloroplast**!)
		- They have their own DNA and resemble bacteria internally.
		- This idea is called **endosymbiotic theory**.

structure and function of the **molecules** that make up cells:

## Biological Macromolecules

### Learning Objectives

- **Distinguish between a covalent bond, ionic bond, and hydrogen bond in terms of the energy needed to break it and what types of atoms can engage in the bond.**
- Use a molecule’s chemical structure to predict whether it will be hydrophobic or hydrophilic.

### Cell Structure

#### Big Idea

- Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes are made from the same types of macromolecules:
	- Carbohydrates
	- Proteins
	- Nucleic Acids
	- Lipids

#### Classes of Biological Macromolecules

##### Carbohydrates
- Plant structure
- Energy
- Starch
- Energy
- Sugar
##### Proteins
- Perform functions
- Make reactions
- Prions
- Muscle
##### Nucleic Acids
- DNA
- RNA
- Stores Information
##### Lipids
- Fats
- Membranes
- Energy Storage
- Cholesterol

### Big Idea

- Molecules are made of **atoms**. 
	- Atoms are connected by **bonds**.
		- *Note: whenever there’s a bend and we don’t write an atom’s symbol, you can assume there is a Carbon there and possibly some number of hydrogens connected to it.*
- Question:
	- This molecule is a form of thyroid hormone, which is crucial for normal growth and brain development. To make it, you need to eat iodine atoms. Why can’t the body just make iodine?
		- Only nuclear reactions, like those in stars or as part of radioactivity, can make or destroy atoms.
		- However, once you have atoms inside your body, you can mix and remix them to make different molecules (if you have the right proteins that can help).

### Bonds

#### Water

- Water is necessary for life.
- The body’s chemical reactions take place in water.
- Water forms polar **covalent bonds** and **hydrogen bonds**.
	- Hydrogen bonds are:
		- Weak bonds

#### Chemical Bonds

##### Ionic Bonds
- Ionic Bonds: Takes all electrons
- End result:
	- One atom gets a + charge
	- Another atom gets a - charge
##### Covalent Bonds
- Covalent Bonds: Shares electrons between them
	- But electrons are not always shared equally
- Some atoms attract electrons more than others
	- Increasing ability to attract electrons
		- --> Across a period -->
	- In chemistry, the ability to attract electrons is called **electronegativity**.
- **Nonpolar bonds**: 
	- are covalent bonds where the atoms share electrons equally: 
		- C-C, C-H
- **Polar bonds**:
	- are covalent bonds where the atoms share electrons unequally: 
		- O-H, N-H, C-O, C-N
##### Hydrogen Bonds
- **Hydrogen Bonds**: 
	- When the electrons next to atom are attractive.
	- Partial + charge on one atom is attracted to partial - charge on another atom.
		- …between water molecules
		- …between DNA molecules

#### Key Ideas

##### Bonds in Water

-  The oxygen is connected to the hydrogen by single **polar covalent bonds**.
- **Oxygen is attracted to hydrogens** on other molecules through **hydrogen bonds**.

### Macromolecules Objectives

- **Use a molecule’s chemical structure to predict whether it will be hydrophobic or hydrophilic.**

#### Process
- Most molecules in a cell move freely in water...but sometimes cells must keep them separate.
	- Enzyme breaks down proteins
	- Barrier between two compartments that does NOT mix with water
- Oil and Water Don't Mix

#### Hydrophobic vs. Hydrophilic

- Oil and other things that have mostly **nonpolar bonds** (**hydrophobic**).
	- **Bonds without charges** are not attracted to water but are to each other.
- Water, and things with lots of **polar covalent or ionic bonds** (**hydrophilic**).
	- The partial + and - charges on water are attracted to other **partial or full charges**.

##### Example

- Oleic Acid
	- 18 Carbons
		- Every time there is a point/bend
- Bonds and Polarity:
	- **Hydrophobic**
		- most of the bonds are nonpolar C-C and C-H bonds.
			- olive oil
- Cows can develop a brain disease calledbovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as mad cow disease. If people eat the meat of a diseased cow, they can get the disease too. What do you think the agent that causes BSE has?
	- A. Protein

| Bonds                 | Polarity |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| Many C-C Bonds        | Nonpolar |
| Many, many, C-H Bonds | Nonpolar |
| 2 C-O bonds           | Polar    |
| 1 O-H                 | Polar    |

# BILD 1 Lecture 3
- ## 1/13
	- ## DNA
	  ## Proteins

## Overview
### Questions
- What are biological molecules made of? 
- How do the structures of DNA and proteins enable their functions?
### Agenda
- Water
- The structure of DNA
- The structure of proteins
### Objective
- Distinguish between a covalent bond, ionic bond, and hydrogen bond in terms of the energy needed to break it and what types of atoms can engage in the bond.

## Water Molecules
### Hydrophobic vs. Hydrophillic
#### Hydrophic
- Oil and other things that have mostly **nonpolar bonds** (**hydrophobic**).
	- **Bonds without charges** are not attracted to water but are to each other.
#### Hydrophilic
- Water, and things with lots of **polar covalent or ionic bonds (hydrophilic)**.
	- The partial + and - charges on water are attracted to other **partial or full charges**.

### Big Ideas
- Covalent bonds are very strong.
- O and N “attract” electrons more strongly than C and H, so O-H, O-C, N-C, N-H bonds are “polar” (partially charged).
	- C-H and C-C bonds are non-polar
- Things that are polar attract other things that are polar or charged and repel non-polar things.
- \+ and – charges attract.

### Bonds in Water

- **Polar covalent bonds**
	- Covalent bonds are **solid lines** because they are **strong**:
		- they are **within** a molecule
- O-H is **polar** because O attracts electrons better than H does
- **Hydrogen bonds**
	- **Dotted line** because they are an attraction **between** molecules
	- Partial + attracts partial – from polar bonds

## Biological Macromolecules
- **Describe structural features and functions of DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids and explain how their structures relate to their functions.**
### Polymers
- A **polymer** is a molecule consisting of an **indefinitely long** chain of similar building blocks called **monomers**.
	- Nucleic Acids 
		- (ie DNA and RNA)
	- Proteins
	- Lipids
### DNA
- (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
- Monomer:
	- Nucleotide
- Polymer: 
	- (2 strands)
- Sugar is deoxyribose
	- Base can be adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C)
#### Structure Idea #1:
- Two DNA molecules together form a double helix.
- The different parts of **nucleotides** make up different parts of the double helix!
	- Phosphate & Sugar = Rail
	- Nitrogenous Base = Half of a Stair Step
#### DNA: Structure and Function
##### Structure:
- **There are 4 bases, which can be in any order on a strand**

- 2 strands held together by hydrogen bonds
- Each base matches with exactly 1 other base on the other strand
##### Function:
- 26 letters in English, can, if you put them in different orders, encode many kinds of information
- 2 numbers (0&1) in computer code can, if you put them in different orders, encode many kinds of information
- **4 bases in 1 strand of DNA can also encode information in organisms**

- “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible **copying mechanism for the genetic material**.”
#### Structure Idea #2: 
- Hydrogen Bonds Hold the Stair Steps (the Bases) Together
	- Break the two strands of DNA apart
##### Complementary base pairs
- In DNA, there are 4 bases: 
	- A, T, G, and C
- The structures of these bases are aligned so that:
	- A pairs with T
	- G pairs with C
### RNA
#### RNA vs. DNA
- RNA Monomer: **Nucleotide**
	- Sugar is **ribose** (with an **OH**)
	- Bases can be adenine (**A**), **uracil (U)**, guanine (**G**), or cytosine (**C**)
	- U pairs with A
- DNA Monomer: **Nucleotide**
	- Sugar is **deoxyribose**
	- Base can be adenine (**A**), thymine (**T**), guanine (**G**), or cytosine (**C**)
#### RNA Structure and Function
- That OH instead of an H means that…
	- RNA can take a variety of shapes:
		- It can base-pair with itself and with DNA, but it can take other shapes too.
			- RNAs sometimes fold in on themselves to partially base-pair
- **OH is more chemically reactive**, so that OH instead of an H means that…
	- **Different RNAs can have different functions:**
		- Carry genetic information
		- Bind to and regulate the function of DNA
		- Bind to other molecules and carry them around
		- Doing chemical reactions inside the cell
	- **RNA is less stable** 
		- (falls apart more readily)
##### Proteins
###### Question
- Cows can develop a brain disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as mad cow disease. If people eat the meat of a diseased cow, they can get the disease too. **What do you think the agent that causes BSE has?**
	- Protein
- The infectious agent in mad cow is pure **protein**

- Protein is called a **prion**
- Polymer of **amino acids**, where different amino acids are represented by different letters
##### Roles of proteins in the cells
- Facilitating chemical reactions
- Moving things around the cell
- Giving a cell its shape
- Create body movement, cause pathogens to die, form nails and hair, etc. …
###### Importance
- **Proteins are one way to treat disease**
- Most “biologic” drugs are proteins
	- Diabetes 
		- (insulin)
	- Arthritis 
		- (Humira, Enbrel)
	- Cancer drugs 
		- (Herceptin, Avastin, Neulasta)
	- Asthma 
		- (dupilumab)
### Proteins
- Monomer:
	- **Amino acid**
		- Side chain: 
			- One of 20
- Polymer:
	- **Backbone**:
		- Always the same 
			- (+NH3-CH-COO-)
#### Amino Acid Parts
##### Side Chain
- **Structure**: 
	- *variable*
		- ***Always*** attached to **alpha carbon**
- **Function**: 
	- its chemistry give proteins their shape and function
- To identify the side chain, find the alpha carbon
##### Backbone
- **Structure**: 
	- *always the same*
		- (+NH3-CH-COO-)
- **Function**:
	- how the amino acid links to other amino acids to form a peptide
##### Amine
- NH2 or NH3+
- Binds to the carboxyl of another amino acid
##### Carboxyl
- COO- or COOH
- Binds to the amine of another amino acid
##### Alpha carbon
- Will always be bound to:
	1. the carboxyl 
		- (COO- or COOH)
	2. the amine 
		- (NH3 or NH2)
	3. a hydrogen atom 
		- (H)
	4. **The Side Chain**
#### Side Chain Types
![[sideChains.png]]
- Note on chemical structures: A full + or – charge will always be indicated. 
- A partial charge usually won’t be.
##### Amino acids joining together
- COO- from one amino acids joins with NH3+ from other amino acid. 
- R is side chain.
###### Questions
- Do the side chains participate in joining the amino acids together?
	- No. Side chains remain and are responsible for protein structure and function!
- Do the charges on the backbone still exist after the amino acids join together?
	- No. There are no charges on the new bond (circled).
- Note: Nonpolar side chain b/c:
	- Only the side chain matters.
		- Remember, the charges on the backbone go away when the amino acid becomes part of a protein.
- If there is a section of a protein that needs to attract negatively-charged ions like Cl-, which of these amino acids might best perform that function?
	- To attract – ions, you need + charges.
	- Arginine was the only one of the choices that had a + charge in the side chain.
	- *Problems in proteins that transport Cl- ions can lead to seizures, cystic fibrosis, and other health problems.*
- How can mad cow disease spread from a cow to a person if prions have no genetic material?
###### Extra
- linear order of amino acids in polypeptide chain
- held together by peptide bonds between amino acids
- tight coils or flat sheets

# BILD 1 Lecture 4
- ## 1/17
	- ## Proteins Structure
	- ### Lipids Structure/Function
		- #### Predict how an amino acid’s side chain will affect the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of a protein.
		- #### Explain how the structure of a phospholipid causes it to form lipid bilayers in water.

## Proteins

### Prions

- **How can mad cow disease spread from a cow to a person if prions have no genetic material?**
	- A **prion** can cause a typical protein to *misfold*
		- i.e. to be shaped differently
![[prionComparison.png]]

### Proteins Fold

- A protein is a chain of amino acids.
- After the amino acid chain is put together, the amino acids interact amongst themselves to **fold**: 
	- put themselves together into a certain 3-D shape
#### Protein Folding
- We can’t always predict whether a certain change will change a protein’s structure, but we can make educated guesses.
##### Image
![[proteinFolding.png]]

### Protein Shape
- **The shape of a protein is important**:
- The shape of a protein allows it to interact with other molecules
	- Substances in the cell that need to undergo chemical reactions
	- Other proteins
	- Cell and organelle membranes
- Some proteins need to be stiff, others flexible
- If a protein is the wrong shape or interacts with the wrong things, it can cause disease
- **Comparison**:
	- **Typical form** of PrP protein (non-infectious)
		- vs.
	- **Disease-causing form (prion)**
		- Note: The lines represent the string of amino acids and what shape it forms.
#### Image
![[proteinComparison.png]]

### Prions

- **Prions spread and cause disease by altering protein shape**
	- The disease-causing shape of PrP , when introduced into a healthy person, causes their healthy PrP proteins to turn prion-shaped.
	- The prions stick together to make a toxic aggregation (clump)
		- See [[prionComparison.png]]
#### Example
- Can someone spontaneously get CJD (mad cow disease), without being exposed to prions or having a mutation?
	- **A. Yes**
		- It’s extremely rare, but sometimes a typically- shaped PrP protein will randomly misfold into a prion shape on its own.

## Protein Structure

- How we describe the shape of a protein: 
	- 4 levels of *protein structure*

### Primary Structure:

- **Just the amino acid sequence**
- **Primary Structure**:
	- List of amino acids, in order, when it was made
		- Determined **solely** by information in DNA
			- (Each amino acid represented by a 3-letter or 1-letter code)
#### Diagram
![[primaryStructure.png]]
#### Question
- Sometimes, cells add a phosphate group to the side chain of an amino acid in a protein.
	- Does this change the protein’s primary structure?
		- **B. No.** 
			- This is like the amino acid putting on a hat - its identity is still the same. 
				- The protein’s primary structure comes from the DNA.

### Secondary Structure:
- **Hydrogen bonding in the backbone**
- Attraction pulling two parts of a protein together: 
	- H-bonds between amino group H’s and carboxyl group O’s on backbone
- **Side chains not involved**
#### Diagram
![[secondaryStructure.png]]
#### Backbone
- Two common ways to get the backbone hydrogen bonds to line up right:
	- A coil called an **α helix**:
		- Hydrogen Bond
	- A flat crinkled structure called a **β pleated sheet**:
		- β strand, shown as a flat arrow pointing toward end
		- Hydrogen bond
##### Diagram
![[backbone.png]]
#### Question
- Imagine a prion interacting with the normal form of the PrP protein and causing it to change to the disease-causing form. 
	- What level of protein structure is different now?
		- **B. Secondary structure**
			- The prion can’t change an amino acid sequence, but two α helices turned into β sheets.
				- See [[proteinComparison.png]]
### Tertiary Structure:
- **Interactions between sidechains on same strand**
	- A single strand of amino acids is called a **peptide**.
		- Tertiary structure shapes a peptide’s overall 3-D shape, determined by interactions among *its own* side chains
#### Diagram
![[tertiaryStructure.png]]

#### Disulfide Bridges
- One special type of bond involved that can be involved in tertiary (and quaternary) structure is the **disulfide bridge**.
- Occurs when the **sulfurs** in side chains of two **cysteine amino acids** interact to form a **covalent bond**:
##### Diagram
![[disulfideBridge.png]]
#### Question
- Which of these possible types of interactions between side chains is strongest?
	- **A. Disulfide bridge** 
		- Because it’s a covalent bond
	- B. Hydrogen bond
	- C. Hydrophobic attraction
#### Amino Acids
- **Multiple strands of amino acids together**
	- Some proteins are made of only 1 strand of amino acids 
		- (**one peptide**).
	- Some proteins are made of >1 strand of amino acids 
		- (**multiple peptides**). 
	- There needs to be a term to describe the shape they make all together.
		- Each individual peptide called a **subunit**.
	- **Hemoglobin protein**:
##### Diagram
![[hemoglobinProtein.png]]

### Quaternary Structure:
- **Interactions between sidechains on *different* peptides**
	- **Same kinds of sidechain interactions as tertiary structure**: 
		- disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions
	- Difference is that sidechains are on **different** peptides
#### Diagram
![[quaternaryStructure.png]]
#### Question
- Which of these levels of structure is not possible for every protein?
	- A. Primary structure – 
		- Every peptide consists of a sequence of amino acids 
	- B. Secondary structure – 
		- Every peptide has a backbone that can make hydrogen bonds
	- C. Tertiary structure – 
		- Every peptide has side chains that can interact
	- **D. Quaternary structure –** 
		- Not every protein is made of multiple peptides.
### Protein Structure Summary
 - **Primary structure**: 
	 - Sequence of amino acids
- **Secondary structure**: 
	- Structure given by hydrogen bonding in backbone
- **Tertiary structure**: 
	- 3-D structure formed by interactions between sidechains on *same peptide*
- **Quaternary structure**: 
	- Structure of multiple peptides formed by interactions between sidechains on *different peptides*
#### Question
- A certain protein mutates so that a tyrosine mutates to a phenylalanine. The tyrosine was involved in a hydrogen bond with another side chain on the same peptide. 
	- Which levels of protein structure would this mutation probably affect?
		- Choose ALL that apply.
- Let’s see where the side chains are…
	1. Find the **alpha carbon**
		1. Find the NH<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and the COOH/COO<sup>-</sup>
		2. Find the carbon between them
	2. What’s not in the backbone is the **side chain**
##### Diagram
![[sideChainExample.png]]

#### Levels of Protein Structure
- **Primary**: 
	- Different amino acids, 
		- so definitely yes
- **Secondary**: 
	- This doesn’t affect the backbone?
		- So, probably no
- **Tertiary**: 
	- Tyrosine was involved in an H-bond within same peptide. 
	- Phenylalanine has no OH, can’t H-bond. 
		- So yes, this probably changed.
- **Quaternary**: 
	- Tyrosine’s H-bond wasn’t between peptides, 
		- so probably no.

-  Storing energy
- Insulation
	- Temperature and electricity have a hard time passing through lipids
- Making membranes to make compartments around and within cells
	- a lipid: 
		- 37 C-C bonds
	- an amino acid: 
		- 9 C-C bonds
#### Question
- Regardless of how much a person weighs, where is the highest concentration of lipids in their body?
	- B. Brain
		- A. Abdomen
		- **B. Brain**
		- C. Liver
		- D. Skin
### Defects
- **Defects in lipids can cause neurological diseases**
	- Neuronal storage diseases: 
		- 50 genetic diseases caused by defects in lipid handling
			- Diagnosed in childhood, typically fatal within 2-5 years
			- Accumulation of toxic lipids in nerve cells
			- Progressive neurological damage, coma, & death
				- Healthy brain vs. 
				- Brain of child with: 
					- ALD, 
						- one of these conditions
### Phospholipids
- **Most membrane lipids are phospholipids**

#### Question

- **Is a phospholipid hydrophobic or hydrophilic?**
	- A. Hydrophobic 
	- B. Hydrophilic
	- ==**C. Both**==
		- **Head** is very *hydrophilic*.
		- **Tail** is very *hydrophobic*.
			- It has both: 
				- this is called ==***amphipathic***==.

#### Question 2
- If you put a bunch of phospholipids in water, how will they arrange themselves?
	- The **heads** will contact the water
	- The **tails** will contact each other and **not** water
There are basically two ways this can happen:

- The membranes in your cells at \#2 *bilayer*
### Phospholipid Bilayer
- **Cell membranes are made of a phospholipid bilayer**
- Creates an inside and an outside that are **separate**, where **different things can go on**

#### Question
- Can you die from drinking too much water?
	- **Yes**
