- ## 1/17
	- ## Proteins Structure
	- ### Lipids Structure/Function
		- #### Predict how an amino acid’s side chain will affect the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of a protein.
		- #### Explain how the structure of a phospholipid causes it to form lipid bilayers in water.

## Proteins

### Prions

- **How can mad cow disease spread from a cow to a person if prions have no genetic material?**
	- A **prion** can cause a typical protein to *misfold*
		- i.e. to be shaped differently
![[prionComparison.png]]

### Proteins Fold

- A protein is a chain of amino acids.
- After the amino acid chain is put together, the amino acids interact amongst themselves to **fold**: 
	- put themselves together into a certain 3-D shape
#### Protein Folding
- We can’t always predict whether a certain change will change a protein’s structure, but we can make educated guesses.

### Protein Shape
- **The shape of a protein is important**:
- The shape of a protein allows it to interact with other molecules
	- Substances in the cell that need to undergo chemical reactions
	- Other proteins
	- Cell and organelle membranes
- Some proteins need to be stiff, others flexible
- If a protein is the wrong shape or interacts with the wrong things, it can cause disease
- **Comparison**:
	- **Typical form** of PrP protein (non-infectious)
		- vs.
	- **Disease-causing form (prion)**
		- Note: The lines represent the string of amino acids and what shape it forms.
#### Image

### Prions

- **Prions spread and cause disease by altering protein shape**
	- The disease-causing shape of PrP , when introduced into a healthy person, causes their healthy PrP proteins to turn prion-shaped.
	- The prions stick together to make a toxic aggregation (clump)
		- See [[prionComparison.png]]
#### Example
- Can someone spontaneously get CJD (mad cow disease), without being exposed to prions or having a mutation?
	- **A. Yes**
		- It’s extremely rare, but sometimes a typically- shaped PrP protein will randomly misfold into a prion shape on its own.

## Protein Structure

- How we describe the shape of a protein: 
	- 4 levels of *protein structure*

### Primary Structure:

- **Just the amino acid sequence**
- **Primary Structure**:
	- List of amino acids, in order, when it was made
		- Determined **solely** by information in DNA
			- (Each amino acid represented by a 3-letter or 1-letter code)
#### Diagram
![[primaryStructure.png]]
#### Question
- Sometimes, cells add a phosphate group to the side chain of an amino acid in a protein.
	- Does this change the protein’s primary structure?
		- **B. No.** 
			- This is like the amino acid putting on a hat - its identity is still the same. 
				- The protein’s primary structure comes from the DNA.

### Secondary Structure:
- **Hydrogen bonding in the backbone**
- Attraction pulling two parts of a protein together: 
	- H-bonds between amino group H’s and carboxyl group O’s on backbone
- **Side chains not involved**
#### Diagram
![[secondaryStructure.png]]
#### Backbone
- Two common ways to get the backbone hydrogen bonds to line up right:
	- A coil called an **α helix**:
		- Hydrogen Bond
	- A flat crinkled structure called a **β pleated sheet**:
		- β strand, shown as a flat arrow pointing toward end
		- Hydrogen bond
##### Diagram
![[backbone.png]]
#### Question
- Imagine a prion interacting with the normal form of the PrP protein and causing it to change to the disease-causing form. 
	- What level of protein structure is different now?
		- **B. Secondary structure**
			- The prion can’t change an amino acid sequence, but two α helices turned into β sheets.
				- See [[proteinComparison.png]]
### Tertiary Structure:
- **Interactions between sidechains on same strand**
	- A single strand of amino acids is called a **peptide**.
		- Tertiary structure shapes a peptide’s overall 3-D shape, determined by interactions among *its own* side chains
#### Diagram
![[tertiaryStructure.png]]

#### Disulfide Bridges
- One special type of bond involved that can be involved in tertiary (and quaternary) structure is the **disulfide bridge**.
- Occurs when the **sulfurs** in side chains of two **cysteine amino acids** interact to form a **covalent bond**:
##### Diagram
![[disulfideBridge.png]]
#### Question
- Which of these possible types of interactions between side chains is strongest?
	- **A. Disulfide bridge** 
		- Because it’s a covalent bond
	- B. Hydrogen bond
	- C. Hydrophobic attraction
#### Amino Acids
- **Multiple strands of amino acids together**
	- Some proteins are made of only 1 strand of amino acids 
		- (**one peptide**).
	- Some proteins are made of >1 strand of amino acids 
		- (**multiple peptides**). 
	- There needs to be a term to describe the shape they make all together.
		- Each individual peptide called a **subunit**.
	- **Hemoglobin protein**:
##### Diagram
![[hemoglobinProtein.png]]

### Quaternary Structure:
- **Interactions between sidechains on *different* peptides**
	- **Same kinds of sidechain interactions as tertiary structure**: 
		- disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions
	- Difference is that sidechains are on **different** peptides
#### Diagram
![[quaternaryStructure.png]]
#### Question
- Which of these levels of structure is not possible for every protein?
	- A. Primary structure – 
		- Every peptide consists of a sequence of amino acids 
	- B. Secondary structure – 
		- Every peptide has a backbone that can make hydrogen bonds
	- C. Tertiary structure – 
		- Every peptide has side chains that can interact
	- **D. Quaternary structure –** 
		- Not every protein is made of multiple peptides.
### Protein Structure Summary
 - **Primary structure**: 
	 - Sequence of amino acids
- **Secondary structure**: 
	- Structure given by hydrogen bonding in backbone
- **Tertiary structure**: 
	- 3-D structure formed by interactions between sidechains on *same peptide*
- **Quaternary structure**: 
	- Structure of multiple peptides formed by interactions between sidechains on *different peptides*
#### Question
- A certain protein mutates so that a tyrosine mutates to a phenylalanine. The tyrosine was involved in a hydrogen bond with another side chain on the same peptide. 
	- Which levels of protein structure would this mutation probably affect?
		- Choose ALL that apply.
- Let’s see where the side chains are…
	1. Find the **alpha carbon**
		1. Find the NH<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and the COOH/COO<sup>-</sup>
		2. Find the carbon between them
	2. What’s not in the backbone is the **side chain**
##### Diagram
![[sideChainExample.png]]

#### Levels of Protein Structure
- **Primary**: 
	- Different amino acids, 
		- so definitely yes
- **Secondary**: 
	- This doesn’t affect the backbone?
		- So, probably no
- **Tertiary**: 
	- Tyrosine was involved in an H-bond within same peptide. 
	- Phenylalanine has no OH, can’t H-bond. 
		- So yes, this probably changed.
- **Quaternary**: 
	- Tyrosine’s H-bond wasn’t between peptides, 
		- so probably no.

### Oil and Water Don’t Mix
- **Hydrophobic** molecules:
	- mostly **nonpolar** bonds
- **Hydrophilic** molecules:
	- **polar bonds** 
	- or **charged**
### Roles of lipids (fats)
-  Storing energy
- Insulation
	- Temperature and electricity have a hard time passing through lipids
- Making membranes to make compartments around and within cells
	- a lipid: 
		- 37 C-C bonds
	- an amino acid: 
		- 9 C-C bonds
#### Question
- Regardless of how much a person weighs, where is the highest concentration of lipids in their body?
	- B. Brain
		- A. Abdomen
		- **B. Brain**
		- C. Liver
		- D. Skin
### Defects
- **Defects in lipids can cause neurological diseases**
	- Neuronal storage diseases: 
		- 50 genetic diseases caused by defects in lipid handling
			- Diagnosed in childhood, typically fatal within 2-5 years
			- Accumulation of toxic lipids in nerve cells
			- Progressive neurological damage, coma, & death
				- Healthy brain vs. 
				- Brain of child with: 
					- ALD, 
						- one of these conditions
### Phospholipids
- **Most membrane lipids are phospholipids**
#### Image
![[phospholipidImage.png]]

#### Question

- **Is a phospholipid hydrophobic or hydrophilic?**
	- A. Hydrophobic 
	- B. Hydrophilic
	- ==**C. Both**==
		- **Head** is very *hydrophilic*.
		- **Tail** is very *hydrophobic*.
			- It has both: 
				- this is called ==***amphipathic***==.
##### Diagram
![[phospholipidDiagram.png]]

#### Question 2
- If you put a bunch of phospholipids in water, how will they arrange themselves?
	- The **heads** will contact the water
	- The **tails** will contact each other and **not** water
There are basically two ways this can happen:
##### Diagrams
![[phospholipidBilayers.png]]
- The membranes in your cells at \#2 *bilayer*
### Phospholipid Bilayer
- **Cell membranes are made of a phospholipid bilayer**
- Creates an inside and an outside that are **separate**, where **different things can go on**

#### Question
- Can you die from drinking too much water?
	- **Yes**
